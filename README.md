 Project Overview
This project implements a Recommendation System using Collaborative Filtering techniques via matrix factorization (such as SVD). The goal is to suggest relevant items (e.g., movies) to users based on their past preferences and behaviors.

Techniques Used
Collaborative Filtering:

Memory-based (user-user or item-item similarity)

Model-based (Matrix Factorization using SVD)

Surprise Library for building and evaluating the recommendation models

Evaluation Metrics:

RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

Train/Test Split for validation

Dataset
The dataset (DataSet.xlsx) includes user-item ratings for movies. It has been processed for use with the Surprise library.

✅ Deliverables
✔️ Jupyter Notebook with collaborative filtering implementation

✔️ Evaluation metrics (RMSE, MAE)

✔️ Example recommendation results

✔️ Dataset file and requirements file included
